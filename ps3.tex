\section{Question 1}
\label{sec1}

\subsection{Part 1}
\label{sec2}

Direct Proof: $x,y,k,m \in \mathbb{Z}, x,y = 2k+1$(odd), then $x+y = 2m$(even) \\
$x + y = (2k+1)+(2k+1) = 4k+2 = 2(k+1), k+1 = m, 2(k+1) = 2m \\
2m$ is a multiple of 2 and even, implying x+y is even $QED$.

\subsection{Part 2}
\label{sec3}

Proof by Contradiction: $x,\,y,\,k,\,m \in \mathbb{Z},\, x,\,y = 2k+1$(odd), then $x+y = 2m+1$(odd) \\ 
$x+y = (2k+1)+(2k+1) = 4k+2 = 2(k+1),\,k+1 = m,\, 2(k+1) = 2m \\
2m$ is even, contradiction found, x+y is even $QED$.

\section{Question 2}
\label{sec4}

Direct Proof: $k,\,m \in \mathbb{Z},\, $ Two consecutive integers are odd and even, so $2k(2k+1)= 4k^2 + 2k = 2(2k^2+k),\, 2k^2+k = m,\, 2(2k^2+k) = 2m$ \\
The product of two consecutive interger (odd and even) are even $QED$.

\section{Question 3}
\label{sec5}

Direct Proof: $x,\,k,\,m \in \mathbb{Z},\, x^2 = 2k$ \\ 
Making consecutive integers: $x^2 + x = x(x+1) = 2k$ \\ 
$(x^2 + x = 2m) = x = 2m - 2k = 2(k - m).$ \\ 
$\therefore$ x is even $QED$

\section{Question 4}
\label{sec6}

Proof by Contradiction: Prove that you need less than 6 games a day for 41 games. Let games$ = g,\,g \in \mathbb{N} \\
g(max) = 5.$ There are 7 days in a week. $5*7 = 35,\,35 < 41$ \\
Contradiction found, 5 games a day is not enough.
  
\section{Question 5}
\label{sec7}

Direct Proof: Let $n,m \in \mathbb{Z},\, n + (n+1) + (n+2) + (n+3) + (n+4) = 5n+10 = 5(n+2),\,(n+2) = m,\,5m$\\
The sum of five consecutive numbers is a multiple of 5, $QED$

\section{Question 6}
\label{sec8}

Biconditional Proof: If n is odd then $3n^2 + 8$ is odd.\\ 
Let $n,\,k,\,m \in \mathbb{Z},\,n = 2k+1,\,3(2k+1)^2+8 = 12k^2 + 12k + 11 \\
= 2(6k^2 + 6k + 5) +1,\,(6k^2 + 6k + 5) = m,\,2m+1$ (odd). \\ 
This statement is true, now for the inverse: \\ 
If n is even then $3n^2 + 8$ is even. \\ 
Let $n,\,k,\,m \in \mathbb{Z},\,n = 2k,\,3(2k)^2+8 = 12k^2 + 8 \\
2(k^2 + 4),\,(k^2 + 4) = m,\, 2m$ (even). \\ 
Statement is true both ways. $QED$
